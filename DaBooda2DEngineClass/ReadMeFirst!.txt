Welcome to the DaBooda 2D Engine...your one stop
to making high quality 2D games.

All you need is your imagination.

This Engine has the following features:

Complete control over maps with 64*64 submaps.
Complete control over sprite manipulation.
An easy texture loading class that supports .bmp and .dds
An overlay class for manipulating and rotating titles.
Support for printing text to the screen.
Complete sound fx control with unlimited buffering and Directional Sound.
Audio Music support for Midi and MP3's.
Direct Input Support for KeyBoards, JoySticks, and even Mouse.
Built in FPS Counter that controls framerate.
Plenty of built in math functions to support sprite collision detection
	and even angle tracking.

System Requirements
	I programmed this engine on a intel celeron 400 mhz 128 mb ram...
	using a 64 MB Card.......and it ran decent.

	I would suggest a higher end machine for this engine does require
	a pretty big payload....at least above my piece a junk...
	It runs great on my wifes computer......its a 1.6 ghz 256 ram...
	(wait why am i stuck with the piece of junk.......no fair)

	Oh Yeah and a Sound Card.........Which Im pretty sure if
	you downloaded this....you are a gamer..so no need for me 
	to worry..........i hope......

To run this example included.......you must first extract the dll into
the windows/system/ folder.....this is located under the folder named
DLL.......Please do this first.......or you will have errors....

Also to note........i am going to post an html help file......but it is still in
the works........just play around with this example......its actually rather easy..
just takes a little getting used to the coding....

Enjoy....

P.S. If you are running a low end machine........the engine uses your desktop bitdepth
     Try Lowering it.......that usually helps
     And the retain keys have been removed..........every programmer needs to do that
     before exporting there proggys to the net.....oh well i digress...
